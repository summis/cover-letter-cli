## Q&A

Q: What model should I use?

A: Probably `gpt-5`. In my testing it produced a high quality letter with a cost of 0.02 $ for an API call. Smaller model can be used for experimenting that the tool works for a lower cost.

Q: But should't people write genuine letters with their own words? Does this just accelerate the AI-slop race to the bottom?

A: The tool is meant as a helper, not as a replacement of human judgement. The recommended use for this tools is not to automate spamming recruiters with AI-letters but to give a good base text for manual editing and reviewing.

Q: Was this tool wibe coded?

A: POC was 100 % wibe product but I improved the code quality until I was happy.
